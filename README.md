# SolidWorks files for assembling a 3-DoF skin deformation device worn on the fingertip

The file "MicromoAssy" is a SolidWorks assembly with all necessary components for creating a 3-DoF skin deformation device. Parts ordered from McMaster include part numbers in the filename. 

We used MicroMo 0615 motors with 64:1 gearboxes, though cheaper hobby motors such as those from Pololu could be used if willing to sacrifice in rendering and actuation quality. Many components were made from Aluminum for associated publication work, to ensure accuracy and strength in production, but previous prototypes used 3D printed parts from an HD3500 and were completely functional. 

Current link lengths progressing from the center of the base to the center of the end effector are 15mm, 9mm, 9mm, 15mm. These lengths can be modified as necessary if users need to suit a wider range of finger sizes, or adapt the design for another purpose. Any kind of tether can be used to connect the motor spools to the base revolute links, however we used Spectra line for its strength and rigidity.
